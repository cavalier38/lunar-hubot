# lunadroid

lunadroid is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. 

### Running lunadroid Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start lunadroid locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:
